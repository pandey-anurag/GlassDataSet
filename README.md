# GlassDataSet
In the first Analysis following steps were performed
#1 KNN using range(1,50)
#Perform cross-validation  
#Manually do feature engineering
#0.605 accuracy
#Logistic Regression-->0.52 accuracy

How it should have been done
#Perform a density Plot
to determine the distribution of the features prior to FE.Most probably the stringent set?
#Perfom PCA
#Perform Feature Selection
#Create neural net
#Define Confusion Matrix(Elastic Net?)
#Draw up classification tree
#Draw up Random tree
#Draw up Tree Bag
#Draw up Naive Bayes Pred
